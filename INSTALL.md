Build Requirements
------------------

You need to have the following packages installed (for Fedora)

 * cmake
 * automake
 * glib2-devel
 * qt-devel

Build instructions
------------------

To build, use the following commands from the source tree.

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

To install, use this command from the same directory (as root, if necessary)

    make install

Build options
-------------

While using the cmake command, you can modify its behaviour using the following flags

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to your install prefix>

This will install the libraries to a location other than /usr/local (the default install prefix)

    -DBUILD_TESTS=off

This will prevent the tests from building

    -DBUILD_DTD_TESTS=off

This will prevent the tests of the Mozilla DTD backend of the Bong library (using GLib)

    -DBUILD_PROPERTIES_TESTS=off

This will prevent the tests of the Mozilla Properties backend of the Bong library (using GLib)

    -DBUILD_PROPERTIES_QT_TESTS=off

This will prevent the tests of the Qt wrapper to the Mozilla Properties backend of the Bong library.
